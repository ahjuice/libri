# Libri - README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

## Description

This app allows a user to find books based on a search query and get details on any of the results listed.

## Requirements/Dependencies

This app was created using Ruby on Rails 5.2.2 and Ruby version 2.6.0. There is no database requirement, and this project does not include ActiveRecord. It parses results from the Google Books API directly.

The app requires Internet access, as the list of books is retrieved from the Google Books API.

## Running Locally

1. `git clone` this repository down to your local machine, then change into the local `libri` directory.
2. Start the local server with `rails s`.
